  	<h2><strong>About Me</strong><h2>
  	<p>I am the mother to two children, ages 24 and 18. I live in Alpharetta. We moved here three years ago after having relocated from Pennsylvania. My daughter graduated from college two years ago. She lives and works in Dallas, Texas. My son, a senior in high school, recently applied to Georgia Tech and has been accepted. He will start school in the fall.</p> 
  	<br>
  	<p>I graduated from King's College in 1981 with a B.S. in Business Administration. After graduation I became an Information Services manager at a privately held manufacturing company in Edison, N.J. which produced printing inks for corrugated boxes and newspapers. We created order processing and inventory control programs for our satellite plants located across the United States. This information was fed on a nightly basis through a dial-up systems using modems. My department was responsible for the development, maintenance and upgrade of these systems, both hardware and software. I worked there until my son was born.</p>
  	<br>
  	<p>I have been working at a small cafe in Alpharetta, as a Customer Service Representative. My goal is to reenter the work force full time. When the opportunity came up to attend this course I jumped on it, as I have always enjoyed problem solving and creating through code.</p>
