  	<p>I am the mother to two young adults, a daughter,  age 24 and and a son, age 18. I've live in Alpharetta for 3 years.  We relocated from Pennsylvania. My daughter graduated from college two years ago.  She lives and works in Dallas, Texas.  My son, a senior in high school, recently applied to Georgia Tech and has been accepted.  He will start school in the fall.</p> 
  	<p>I graduated from King's College in 1981 with a B.S. in Business Administration.  After graduation I became an Information Services Manager at a privately held manufacturing company in Edison, N.J.  We produced printing inks for corrugated boxes and newspapers such as "The New York Times".  We created order processing and inventory control programs for our satellite plants located across the United States.  Inventory information was fed on a nightly basis through a dial-up communication system to our local IBM 3090.  My department was responsible for the development, maintenance and upgrade of the satellite systems, both hardware and software.  I was employed there until my son was born.</p>
  	<p>I have been working at a small cafe in Alpharetta, as a Customer Service Representative.  I enjoy the group I work with and the people I serve.  The owner is a young man who runs his business in a very organized manner.  He is proactively responsive to both his employees and his customers.  My long term goal is to re-enter the work force full time. When the opportunity came up to attend this course I jumped on it, as I have always loved problem solving and creating through code.</p>
